            <h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>
            <p>
                Arittro here. If you're seeing this, that means I'm probably dead—very pathetic, I know, right? <br>
                It's sad that I couldn't attend my own funeral or give my last hug and message to my friends and family. <br>
                But no worries, I've left a message for the people I cared about. <br>
<br>
                Today is March 26, 2025—the day this site was created. <br>
                Look for your name to see my last message for you! If your name isn’t here, pardon this dead guy.
